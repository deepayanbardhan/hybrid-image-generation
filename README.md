# hybrid-image-generation

Hybrid Image is an image that can be perceived in one of two different ways. The view depends on the viewing distance. It is based on how human beings process visual input. 
A popular example of a hybrid image is shown below:

Looking at the picture from a short distance, one can see a sharp image of a man, with only a hint of blurry distortion hinting at the presence of an overlaid image. Viewed from a distance in which the fine detail blurs, the unmistakable face of a cat emerges.

Similarly, in the example I have taken 2 images - First of the KFC logo and second of the Macdonald's mascot. They are converted to their frequency domain and then a weighted frequency image is generated with certain proportions of each image. That newly generated image is now converted back to the spatial domain to represent the hybrid image.
